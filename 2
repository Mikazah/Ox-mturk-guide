<h1>TheMightyOx's Mturk 101 Guide</h1>

  <div id="header-desc">
Because I don't know the level of experience people have with Mturk, this document includes stuff for those that haven't started, just starting and those that are more advanced. Please just skip over any parts that may not apply to you. It’s easier than me asking a bunch of questions to figure out what's relevant.
</div>
</div>

<div id="section">
<h2>Mturk Basics</h2>
  
<div class="section-text">
Amazon's Mechanical Turk, or Mturk as its best known, is the biggest and most well-known of the crowdsourcing/microtasking platforms. For those looking to earn some extra money online, it can offer one of the better opportunities to do just that. But finding the right groove and making Mturk be worth your time can seem confusing and like it may not be worth your effort. This course is designed to help those just starting out on the Mturk platform as well as those who have been on it for a little while but feel they aren't earning as much as they feel they should.<br>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>What is Mturk?</h2>

<div class="section-text">
Mturk is a crowdsourcing platform. Requesters post up varied form of tasks that they need you to do. Tasks include, but are not limited to, surveys and academic studies, data lookup and entry, categorization, voice recording, transcription, and much more. For each task you will get paid the amount specified on the HIT description. Requestors may also offer bonuses for your work, which is sent to you at a later time to your Mturk account.
</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Signing Up</h2>

<div class="section-text">
To get started, <a href="https://worker.mturk.com/">go here to sign up for a worker account.</a>  It will take up to 48 hours to find out if you are accepted. Mturk accepts most US based applicants who are 18 or above. There are some periods that they initially reject applications. Don't fret if that happens. When spots open again they will send you an email approving you. Please note, if you are outside of the USA, you most likely will not be accepted. Mturk occasionally accepts Canada, UK applicants, and very rarely other countries. If you are outside the US and do get accepted, you will only be able to use your earnings to buy things on Amazon.
</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Payments</h2>

<div class="section-text">
Mturk only pays through Amazon Payments. After you are accepted you will have to open an Amazon Payments account. They will take about 24 hours to try to verify your identity. If they can't verify you may be asked to provide proof of identity such as a state issued ID, a utility bill with your name and correct address or some other form of identification. You will also have to link a bank account to your Amazon payments account. You can choose one of two ways to receive your earnings. The first is deposited directly into the linked bank account. Or you can have your earnings transferred as a credit to your Amazon account.
</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>The First 10 Days:</h2>

<div class="section-text">
For the first 10 days on Mturk you are limited to 100 HITs accepted per day. Your goal during the first 10 days should be to reach 1000 HITs by the time you are out of the 10-day probation period.<br>
<br>
Doing higher paid survey HITs versus lower paid batches is the best way to maximize your time during your first ten days.<br>
<br>
You should also start installing the scripts recommended later on in this document. This will allow you to get a feel for them. Most scripts are fairly straight forward in their use and you should be able to get used to how they work in your first 10 days.<br>
<br>
Don't get discouraged. The first few days can feel like it's not worth the time or it's not going to work for you. As time goes on and you find your rhythm, your earnings will increase.<br>
<br>
Understand that Mturk starts slow for most people. You want to work toward completing 500, 1000, 2500 and 5000 HITs. Those are the main milestones that open up more work. A few HITs might require 10000 but they are rare.
</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>How to find HITs</h2>

<div class="section-text">
There are a few different ways to find HITs. I’ll list out 3 here:

<ol>
<li>Looking at the listings right on the Mturk site. This is the most inefficient way of doing things and I don't recommend it unless you are on a device that can’t use scripts and it’s hard to switch between tabs.</li>

<li>Use <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/36368-hit-forker">Hit Forker</a>. This is the first script we will talk about (more later) . Once HIT Forker is running, it will show you all the most recent HITs that have been posted and updates every 5 seconds or so. Its color coded based on reports on how good the HITs earned. And has buttons to add HITs to Panda Crazy, a script we will talk about a bit later.</li>

<li><a href="https://forum.turkerview.com/forums/daily-mturk-hits-threads.2/">Join Turkerview</a> and follow the daily HIT threads.  The daily threads offer HITS people are doing/have done. Plus opinions on the work and other fun witty banter. There are other Mturk based forums too like Mturkcrowd, TUrker Nation, Mturk forum and of course reddit, but TurkerView is best in my opinion.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Qualifications</h2>
<div class="section-text">
Almost every HIT has some sort of qualifier on it. A lot are just based on the amount of HITs you have or your location (USA only etc). But some requesters use Qual HITs or tests in order to find a small group of people to do their HITs. That’s referred to as a closed qual HIT. And they can be some of the most lucrative work on Mturk.<br>

So this means you should always be on the lookout for qual HITs and tests. This portion of <a href="https://turkerview.com/qualifeye/">Turkerview</a>  helps by automatically posting possible qual HITs and surveys. Also, if you see a qual you want, there is no harm in trying to contact the requester. It’s a long shot but I also know of some people who have gotten good quals this way.<br>

Continuing to look for qualifications you can get is one of the best ways to increase your Mturk earnings over time.
</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Batches vs Surveys</h2>

<div class="section-text">
Batches are HITs that you can do more than one of. Usually things like data entry, info lookup, transcription categorization and other HITs like that. Batch HITs can be very lucrative if you can find something that is quick to do and the pay is decent. A batch that has a great flow can be very nice way to Turk. And depending on the size of the batch, and how many people are doing it, a batch can last hours. These kinds of HITs usually range between 1c and 10c although sometimes higher<br>
<br>
Surveys and Studies - These are usually only 1 hit and means you have to constantly be looking for more HITs. But they tend to be much higher value. 25c-$3 or more. And regularly come with the chance to earn bonuses on top of the amount. These HITs can last from minutes to an hour and rarely longer, with the reward going higher, the longer the HIT.<br>
<br>
So which should you do? The answer to that is 2 fold. 1st.. personal preference. Some people hate doing surveys. Others find batches a drag. If you are in one of those groups, so you don't have your entire time on Mturk, you probably want to gravitate toward what you like to do.<br>
<br>
The other factor is What’s Available when you are turking. If there are some good batches up but surveys are slow, then batches is the way to go. And if the opposite is true, then surveys. Me personally I do both.. surveys mostly with good batches mixed in.
</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Rejections and how to handle them</h2>

<div class="section-text">
Rejections are going to happen. No one is perfect. And some requesters are just assholes. Obviously the best way to prevent them is to always be paying attention and doing your best work. But even so.. you will eventually get a rejection. Its not the end of the world. Here are some tips on how to deal with rejections:<br>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Get your numbers up - You want to keep your approval percentage above 95%. That lets you do most HITs. Above 99% will allow you to do every HIT posted. To keep your numbers up, its good to do quick filler batches. MLDataLabeler have a bunch of good batches like this. They aren't great money but can allow you to do a bunch quickly. The more HITs you have, the less a rejection will hurt you.</li>

<li>Always pay attention to instructions - Obvious I know. But I got 20 of my 95 rejections from one batch because I missed that they didn't want the http:// part of the urls.</li>

<li>Watch for attention checks - After a scare last year about bots infiltrating Mturk, requesters that post survey and study HITs have loaded them with attention checks.. to make sure you are paying attention, to make sure you aren't just random clicking, and to make sure you aren't using a bot. As you gain experience, you will be able to notice these much easier.</li>

<li>Check <a href=" https://turkerview.com/mturk-scripts/">Turkerview</a> and <a href="https://turkopticon.ucsd.edu/">Turkopticon</a> - Some requesters are just unfair or expect perfection. Those are best avoided. There are two good resources to help with that: <a href=" https://turkerview.com/mturk-scripts/">Turkerview</a>, over the last year or so, has become the go to resource for requester and HIT ratings. It has probably surpassed Turkopticon in usefulness now. They show you not only an overall review of requesters, but also reviews of individual HITs as well. If you install the TurkerVIewJS, Ratings will show up right on the HIT pages.<br>
<a href="https://turkopticon.ucsd.edu/">Turkopticon</a> is a website where workers can review Mturk requesters. There is also a script you can download to be able to see it while you are working. The best way though is as part of the Mturk Suite extension listed below. Check a requesters "TO" to see if they pay fairly, reject unfairly and communicate well with the people that work on their HITs.<br>
  
Both of these allow you to make better choices in deciding which HITs to do.<br></li>
</ol>

<h3>IF you do get a rejection</h3>

Don't be afraid to contact the requester. If the requester has listed a reason, tell them why you feel it wasn't deserved.. or if it was deserved, apologize and explain why it happened (you are new, didn't understand etc). Be nice and polite and ask if there is any way to rectify the situation. By taking the time to show them that you care enough to contact them, they will see that you are conscientious and care about the work and they might rescind that rejection.
</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>One General Tip</h2>

<div class="section-text">
Queue HITs. This is something I didn't find out until I was working on Mturk for more than 3 months. You can accept more than one HIT at a time. Say you see two survey HITs, both with 60 min timers. Grab them both. Then work on one, submit and then work on the other. There are days I have 5-10 HITs in queue. Just watch your timers so HITs don't start expiring on you.<br>
</div>
  
<h2>Scripts</h2>

<div class="section-text">
Anyone who makes decent money on Mturk uses scripts to help them. But please don't mix up scripts and bots. Any program that Is designed to somehow complete the HIT for you is not allowed by Mturk. But scripts that help you catch HITs and perform other functions are completely legal. All Scripts require either the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo">Tampermonkey extension</a> if you are using Google Chrome, or the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">Greasemonkey extension</a>  if you are using Firefox.<br>
<br>

<h3>Here are the scripts I use</h3>

  <h4><a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/search?q=Panda+Crazy">Panda Crazy</a></h4>
This is a series of 3 scripts that work together to help you find and catch HITs that have been posted. <a href="http://pandacrazy.allbyjohn.com/">This link is a tutorial and Documentation.</a> The script looks complicated and confusing but it's actually pretty easy. My earnings would be cut in half or more if I didn't use this particular script.<br>
<br>
The first thing you need to do after installing Panda Crazy is open a new browser window (PC needs its on separate window to run correctly) and <a href="https://worker.mturk.com/requesters/PandaCrazy/projects">go to this URL to run the script</a> Once that is open you can start adding HITs. If you are using hitnotifier like mentioned earlier, or are frequenting any of the various Mturk related forums, you should now see buttons on the HITs that say "panda" "once" and "search" For survey HITs just press the "once" button and it will automatically add it to PC and the script will start searching for that HIT. If it finds it, you will hear music and see a browser notification. It will place the HIT into your queue and you can work on it from there. But don't go crazy adding too many HITs. The script cycles through them about 1 a second. If you add 50 HITs for PC to search for, then each HIT will only be looked for about once a minute. Most people keep it at 10 or below. Going above 20 is not advised.<br>
<br>

<h4><a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/18991-mturk-worker-dashboard-enhancer">Dashboard Enhancer</a> </h4> 

This simple script just adds some additional stats to your dashboard. You can see info like how many rejections you can get before falling below 95% approval and a few other stats that can give you insight into your account.<br>
<br>

<h4>Mturk Suite for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mturk-suite/iglbakfobmoijpbigmlfklckogbefnlf?hl=en-US">Chrome</a> or <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mturk-suite/">Firefox</a></h4>

Mturk Suite is a browser extension that combines multiple scripts under one umbrella. It also includes a Hit Finder and Hit Catcher that some prefer over Panda Crazy. The best thing about this suite is that it includes an easy way to track your earnings as well as a HIT database that will allow you to check your past work to see if you have already done HITs for a requester. Overall, it's an incredible resource in many ways.
